# A little Information about RDMS.

#### The Request Document Management System (RDMS) is a web-based project that aims to enhance communication among students, registrars, and teachers, while also providing students with easy access to required documents. This system simplifies the process for registrars to manage student requests and documents, and has an easy-to-use design that expedites the process. 

 #### The primary goal of this project is to design and develop an efficient Request and Document Management System (RDMS) for St. Vincent de Ferrer College of Camarin Inc., which will provide an organized approach to managing student documents.
