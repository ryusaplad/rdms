# A little Information about RDMS.

A Request Document Management System (RDMS) will be developed to improve communication among students, facilitators, registrars, and teachers, as well as to allow students to obtain required documents. Furthermore, it allows facilitators to make it easier to send the request to the registrar after the student submits the necessary requirements. It also has an easy-to-use design, which will expedite the process.

The primary goal of this project is to design and develop a Request and Document Management System (RDMS) for the St. Vincent de Ferrer College of Camarin Inc to provide a more efficient and organized method of managing student documents.
