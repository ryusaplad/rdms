# A little Information about RDMS.

A Request Document Management System (RDMS) will be developed to improve communication among students, registrars, and teachers, as well as to allow students to obtain required documents. Furthermore, it allows registrar to make it easier to manage the request and documents of the student. It also has an easy-to-use design, which will expedite the process.

The primary goal of this project is to design and develop a Request and Document Management System (RDMS) for the St. Vincent de Ferrer College of Camarin Inc to provide a more efficient and organized method of managing student documents.
